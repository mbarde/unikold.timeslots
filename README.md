# unikold.timeslots

Dexterity based re-implementation of https://github.com/collective/uwosh.timeslot with extended functionalities.

> uwosh.timeslot offers a simple way to allow users of a Plone site to
> register for events (for example: training sessions or office hours).

Originally this was an extension of `uwosh.timeslot` for usage in the CMS of the [University of Koblenz -Landau](<[http://uni-koblenz-landau.de](http://uni-koblenz-landau.de/)>).

## Features

- Define date based timeslots users can sign up to
- Logged in users can watch and manage their signups
- Timeslots can have capacities (waiting list and automatically moving up included)
- Customizable notification emails
- Dynamically extend signup form with EasyForm ([https://github.com/collective/collective.easyform](https://github.com/collective/collective.easyform))

User states:

1. `unconfirmed`: Manager hast to confirm signup
2. `signedup`: User is signed up
3. `signedoff`: User is not signed up
4. `waiting`: User is on waiting list (moves up when another signup is cancelled)

## Dependecies

## Development

### Setup

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Test, lint & format

```
venv/bin/pytest
venv/bin/pytest -k name_of_a_test
venv/bin/black src/
venv/bin/flake8 src/
venv/bin/isort src/
```

### Run a local Plone instance

Create a Zope/Plone instance once (creates `instance/`, gitignored, with an
`admin` user):

```
venv/bin/mkwsgiinstance -d instance -u admin:admin
```

Start it:

```
venv/bin/runwsgi instance/etc/zope.ini
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 and use "Create a new Plone site" (log in as
`admin`), adding `unikold.timeslots` (and `collective.easyform`) as add-ons
during site creation, or afterwards via *Site Setup > Add-ons*.

Set `debug-mode on` in `instance/etc/zope.conf` for template auto-reload
during development (Python changes still need a restart).

Signups and cancellations send notification emails, which fail locally
without a configured SMTP server (`ConnectionRefusedError`). With
`debug-mode on` and `Products.PrintingMailHost` installed (part of
`requirements-dev.txt`), outgoing mail is printed to the instance log
(`instance/var/log/event.log`) instead of actually being sent - no local
mail server needed.
